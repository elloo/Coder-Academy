# CHALLENGE 2 - Random Number Magician
A magician on the street is about to start their magic trick. 
First, they are requesting a number (an Integer) from people on the street. 
They will then use that number, to chose that many random, whole numbers, between 1 and 100.
## 2.1 - Core Functionality
Create a method for the magician that will generate a list [array] of random, whole numbers from a given integer.
_E.g._ random_number_generator(5) should return [23,34,1,2,13] ... not the same numbers, but should return 5 of them
## 2.2 - Guaranteed Randomness
Can you ensure these numbers will be unique?
