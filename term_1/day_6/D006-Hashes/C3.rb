### Challenge 3 - Medium (long!)
### Yellow Pages Terminal Edition
# This is the standard phonebook example but with extra stuff!
# Let users view, add, or remove entries in a phone book.
#           - view should just show all entries
#           - add should provide prompts for each property of the entry eg.
#                   what is the name?     ___
#                   what is the number?   ___
#           - remove should ask for a name, and if that name is in the phone book then ask the user to confirm the removal. Only remove the entry once the user confirms that they want to remove it!
#
# These phonebook entries should contain a lot of information about a person, like a really old-fashioned phone book!
# eg. a person's name, phone number, workplace, address
# They should also be able to view the phone book's entire collection of entries in a nicely formatted message.
# eg.
