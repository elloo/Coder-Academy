### Challenge 5 - Hard
### Shopping Wishlist App
# Create a catalogue that lets users find out prices of items and add items to a user's wishlist.
# However, everything must be organized inside a single variable!
# eg. coffee_shop = [["flat white", "black", "iced"], ["toast", "muffin"]]
# So, display categories of items to the users.
# Let the user pick a category to see the items inside of it.
# Let the user pick an item and add it to their wishlist.
# Display the user's wishlist.
# Ask the user if they want to keep shopping - quit the app if they don't.
#
# Extension twist: When displaying the user's wishlist, count every item in their array.
#                  Display the wishlist as {quantity} {item_name}
#
# Hint: You will need a combination of for loops, while loops, array adding & removing methods -- a lot of stuff!
