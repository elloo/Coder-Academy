Use flexbox to make a layout like this:

These are commonly called "cards" in CSS frameworks. 
You should be focusing on the structure of the card, and then use flexbox to make 6 cards arrange nicely on the page.
Note the effects like the box-shadow, and how there's headers and text in each card.
And yes, the cards should include a HTML button.

Optional: Implement cards into one of the other layouts from the previous challenges.
