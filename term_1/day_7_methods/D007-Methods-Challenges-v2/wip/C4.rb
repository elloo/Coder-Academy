### Challenge 4 - Medium
### Virtual Plant Game
#
# Create an app that lets a user look after a virtual plant.
# The user should be able to do one action per day (where each cyle of a game loop is one day).
# - name or rename the plant
# - sing to the plant to increase its happiness
# - feed the plant to decrease its hunger
# - water the plant to decrease its thirst
# - spray the plant with bug repellent to decrease its bug count
# - quit the game
# Each of those actions should be a separate method.
# Use a case statement to process the user's choice and trigger a method.
# At the end of each day, give the user an update on the plants stats:
# - name
# - happiness
# - hunger
# - thirst
# - bug count
# Remember to use global variables to let the functions modify the variable values!
