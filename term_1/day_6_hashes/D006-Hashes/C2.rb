# Present the user with different categories of something.
# Then, ask them to provide a maximum number of characters for each entry.

#

data = {"chocolate things" => ["chocolate cake", "hot chocolate", "choc"], "liquids" => ["water", "hot chocolate", "cola", "juice"], "lollies" => ["skittles", "M&Ms", "licorice"]}


# eg. The app shows all categories (eg. chocolate things, liquids, lollies)
#     The user wants to see liquids
#     then the user wants to see liquids with 4 characters or less in their name
#     the end result is "cola"
