### Challenge 5 - Medium
### Season Schedule App
# Another update to this challenge!
#
# This time, make it so that this line of code will give a decent result:
# puts "Hello! I hope you're having a nice #{getCurrentSeason}!"
# That line should have a result of:
# "Hello! I hope you're having a nice autumn!"
#
# This requires wrapping your previous solution to this challenge in a method, and returning the current season as a result of the method.

# Original challenge text:
#
# This app will tell users what the current season and time of day is.
# eg. "It is a summer morning."
#
# Steps:
# Find out what day of the year it is (eg. 42 / 366)
# Create variables for each season - these variables should store a range of days of the year that covers when that season occurs.
# Check if the current day of the year falls within a certain range of days to find out what the current season is.
#
# Similarly, use ranges on the current hour of the day to identify if it's morning, noon, afternoon, evening, nighttime, midnight
# Tell the user what stage of the day & what season of the year it is.
#
# Use hashes to store the ranges for the seasons and stages of the day.







## Keep this line of code at the end of your script:
puts "Hello! I hope you're having a nice #{getCurrentSeason}!"
