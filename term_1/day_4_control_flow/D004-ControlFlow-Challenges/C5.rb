### Challenge 5 - Sneakpeek (Medium)
### Password checker
# We're gonna make a very simple password-checking app! All it does is tell the user if their password is correct - not actually logging in or doing new things, but still. Loops & control flow are important for this.
# Prompt the user to enter a password.
# Compare the user's input to the predefined password (see the starting code below).
# If the user's password is correct, give them a nice message about their password-entering skills.
# If the user's password is incorrect, decrement the attempt counter, tell the user how many attemps they have left, and go back to the start of the loop.
# If the decrement counter reaches 0, break the loop.

predefined_password = "Password1"
attempt_counter = 5
